Sublime Web Suite
=================

SublimeSuite is meant to be a one-install solution for getting a good CSS/HTML/JavaScript development environment

It currenlty includes the following tools with changed settings:
* JsFormat
* CSSFormat
* Basic HTML Reindent

##Features
* Format JS and CSS
* Follows Google Styleguide (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml#Declaration_Order)
* Reindent HTML
* Tries hard to keep your cursor at the position it was before you reformatted

##TODO
[ ] Edge out corner cases in which we don't follow Google Style perfectly
[ ] Sort CSS-Properties alphabetically as suggested in the Styleguide
[ ] Make the HTML Formatter do more than just reindent
